## **Problem Statement**

Education is a powerful tool for social mobility, but access to quality education remains a challenge, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries. Many students struggle with financial constraints and lack access to fair, transparent, and secure education financing options.

Traditional student loans often come with high-interest rates, complex paperwork, and predatory lending practices that discourage students from pursuing higher education. Additionally, existing scholarship and fundraising models focus on charity rather than sustainable financial responsibility.

### **Key Challenges**

- **Financial Accessibility:** Students in low-income families have no way to secure loans without collateral or high credit scores.
- **Lack of Privacy:** Loan applications require users to disclose sensitive financial data, leading to security risks and bias.
- **Inefficiency of Existing Loan Systems:** Traditional student loans are slow, centralized, and bureaucratic.
- **Lack of Personalized Learning Paths:** Students struggle to find the right courses that align with their career goals.
- **Absence of Incentives for Learning:** No mechanism exists to reward students for completing courses and repaying loans responsibly.

## **üéØ Our Solution - EduFi**

EduFi is a decentralized education financing platform that combines **privacy-preserving micro-financing with AI-driven course matching**. It enables students to access education loans **without exposing sensitive financial data** while ensuring responsible repayment.

With **zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-Proofs)** for income verification and **AI-powered recommendations**, EduFi makes education financing secure, personalized, and accessible. Students receive micro-loans that they must **pay back based on hard work and reputation**, fostering financial responsibility rather than reliance on charity.

The platform also introduces a **Decentralized Reputation System**, where students build an **on-chain education score** (similar to a credit score) based on completed courses and timely loan repayments. This incentivized learning system ensures that students not only upskill themselves but also contribute back to the ecosystem.

## Generating ZK Proofs

### 1. Compile Circuit

```bash
circom incomeProof.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
```

### 2. Generate the proving and verification keys:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 12 pot12_0000.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot12_0000.ptau pot12_0001.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot12_0001.ptau pot12_final.ptau
snarkjs groth16 setup incomeProof.r1cs pot12_final.ptau incomeProof_0000.zkey
snarkjs zkey contribute incomeProof_0000.zkey incomeProof_0001.zkey
snarkjs zkey export verificationkey incomeProof_0001.zkey verification_key.json
```

### 3. Deploy contract

```bash
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network opencampus
```

### Add all .env files in backend, frontend, contracts folders.

### 4 . In backend folder generate vk hash

```bash
cd backend
node register_vk.js
```

### 5. Add VK_HASH to .env in contracts folder

### 6 . Run backend

```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```

### 7 . Run frontend
